# Pynity

Pynity is a an extension of Lee Stemkoski's Python based 3D graphics framework as outlined in his [development series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxpdybrffYlPqkCyvvLfvwsaB7CB1r0pV).

This project will initially follow along with his series and be updated after each chapter.

After completion of the series, a roadmap will be developed of features to be added for future developement, as well as tools to assist in the creation of projects utilizing the framework.

The goal of this project is to act as a record of my journey in learning and understanding of 3D graphics frameworks. It will be considered  as successful endeavor when I useable, saleable product is produced using the framework.
